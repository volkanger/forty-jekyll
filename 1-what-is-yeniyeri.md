We are a group of Information Technology professionals. We work with multiple disciplines in our daily routines, including design, development, product, and most importantly content. The dynamics of creating content, and getting final consent from clients and stakeholders is always a challange that we wanted to take a shot at. With YeniYeri, you'll see this fresh look into content generation, content review, and hand-over. 

In 2019, your best chance was to use a kind of structed data to make the data flow between the content team, clients/stakeholders, and design/development teams. Which was so tidious for the content team, and pretty hard to decyper for developers, and not even useful for designer. 

Now, YeniYeri allows the designs -in any phase or shape, from napkin sketches to Sketch exports- to accept content, visually. A designer would place the image to YeniYeri, and then mark the areas that she is looking for content update. Content team would work on the marked areas to write anything they like, and clients would review the content knowing what text belongs to where. 

In short, YeniYeri is a collaboration tool to help teams produce the right content to right places, with the help of visuals to avoid confusion.
